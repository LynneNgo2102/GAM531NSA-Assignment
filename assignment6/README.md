One of the main challenges I faced was getting all the files and components (such as the Camera, Shader, and Game classes) to work together correctly. I also struggled with handling mouse movement at first, since the camera rotated even when the mouse was just moving over the window. I resolved this by adding a check so rotation only happens while holding the left mouse button. Overall, this project helped me better understand how 3D transformations, camera matrices, and input handling work in OpenTK.
