In this project, I implemented the Phong lighting model using OpenTK in C#. The application sets up a 3D rendering context to display a rotating cube with ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting effects. The vertex shader calculates vertex positions and normals in world space and passes them to the fragment shader, which computes the final color based on the Phong model. A single point light source with adjustable position, color, and intensity illuminates the cube. The cube’s geometry was defined with accurate normal vectors for each face to ensure realistic light reflection, and the scene uses model, view, and projection matrices for proper 3D perspective. The camera and object transformations are handled using OpenTK’s Matrix4 utilities.

One of the main challenges was ensuring that vertex normals were correctly calculated and matched with the cube’s geometry. Initially, the lighting appeared distorted due to incorrect vertex attribute setup, which caused the shader to interpret texture coordinates as normals. After correcting the vertex layout and normal data, the Phong lighting behaved as expected, producing smooth shading and highlights on the cube’s faces.
